**1. Animating State Changes with Bindings:** <br>
  The `animation()` modifier can be applied directly to a `@State` binding, which allows SwiftUI to animate the transition between values. 
  This works even for non-continuous data types like Booleans because SwiftUI animates the resulting view changes rather than the value itself.

**2. Implicit vs. Explicit Binding Animation:** <br>
  - Normally, animations are applied to views, which implicitly animate when the state changes.
  - With binding animations, the animation is applied to the state change itself, and the view updates accordingly without explicitly defining an animation on it.


```Swift
  struct ContentView: View {
      @State private var animationAmount = 1.0
  
      var body: some View {
          VStack {
              Stepper("Scale amount", value: $animationAmount.animation(), in: 1...10)
  
              Spacer()
  
              Button("Tap Me") {
                  animationAmount += 1
              }
              .padding(40)
              .background(.red)
              .foregroundStyle(.white)
              .clipShape(.circle)
              .scaleEffect(animationAmount)
          }
      }
  }
```

The above code demonstrates how binding animations work in SwiftUI:
  - **Binding animations**: The Stepper smoothly animates size changes because it uses `$animationAmount.animation()`. This tells SwiftUI to interpolate values between the old and new state, creating a smooth transition.
  - **Instant vs. Animated Changes**: The Button updates animationAmount immediately, causing a jump in size instead of a smooth transition. This happens because the button modifies animationAmount directly without an animation modifier, so SwiftUI applies the new value instantly.
